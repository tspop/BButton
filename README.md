#BButton 2.0

BButton is a subclass of UIButton that looks like the [Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.1](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) buttons.

Forked from [@mattlawer / BButton](https://github.com/mattlawer/BButton) and refactored for more awesome.

Includes [@leberwurstsaft / FontAwesome-for-iOS](https://github.com/leberwurstsaft/FontAwesome-for-iOS), fixed for iOS from the original [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/).
